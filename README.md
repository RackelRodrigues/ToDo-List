# TO DO-LIST


hello, I'll show you what I'm doing:
<br/>

I'm on a to-do list the colors I want to use are blue (navy), beige and black
there are a lot of comments, I know it's not a great job for a more precise programmer to understand as much as possible until when you need to pick it up again to improve
</br>

This project is about organizing day-to-day activities
